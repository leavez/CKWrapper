 This is the character set that CKTextKit should attempt to avoid leaving as a trailing character before your
 truncation token.  By default this set includes "\s\t\n\r.,!?:;" so you don't end up with ugly looking truncation
 text like "Hey, this is some fancy Truncation!\n\n...".  Instead it would be truncated as "Hey, this is some fancy
 truncation...".  This is not always possible.

 Set this to the empty charset if you want to just use the "dumb" truncation behavior.  A nil value will be
 substituted with the default described above.
